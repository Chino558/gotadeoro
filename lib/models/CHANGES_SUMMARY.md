- ✅ Updated app bar styling to be more consistent with the app design
- ✅ Improved text field styling with better padding and colors

### 2. **WhatsApp Integration Fixes**

- ✅ Cleaned up unused error handling methods

### 4. **Calculator Functionality**
The calculator now:
- Shows weight selection with preset buttons
- Allows custom weight input in grams
- Calculates price in real-time
- Has settings accessible via the settings icon
- Does NOT have WhatsApp sharing (as requested)

### 5. **Bill Screen WhatsApp**
The WhatsApp functionality is now properly located in the bill screen where:
- Users can share the complete order details
- Proper formatting with itemized list
- Includes table number and total
- Works with both mobile and web WhatsApp

## File Changes:
1. **weight_calculator_screen.dart** - Major UI updates and code cleanup
2. **price_display.dart** - Simplified styling without gradient
3. **weight_button.dart** - Updated card styling to match design
4. **whatsapp_service.dart** - Fixed URL handling with proper fallback

The app now matches the design from screenshot 4 with cleaner, more modern card-based UI while maintaining all the calculator functionality. The WhatsApp sharing is properly placed in the bill/checkout screen where it makes more sense contextually.
