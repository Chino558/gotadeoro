# Circular Weight Slider - Handle Position Fix

## Problem Solved
The selection handle was not following the user's touch correctly. When users touched the dial at 6 o'clock (1 kg), the handle would jump to 12 o'clock (2 kg) or other incorrect positions.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the state management of the angle. The widget wasn't properly updating the internal `_currentAngle` state when the user interacted with it, causing a disconnect between where the user touched and where the handle appeared.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **State Management Fix**
```dart
// Added setState() to properly update the angle state
void _handleTapDown(TapDownDetails details, BoxConstraints constraints) {
  // ... calculate angle ...
  setState(() {
    _currentAngle = angle;  // NOW properly updating state
  });
  // ... rest of the logic ...
}
```

### 2. **Consistent Angle Updates**
```dart
void _handlePanUpdate(DragUpdateDetails details, BoxConstraints constraints) {
  // ... calculate angle ...
  setState(() {
    _currentAngle = angle;  // Consistent state update during drag
  });
  // ... rest of the logic ...
}
```

### 3. **Proper Initialization**
The widget now correctly initializes the angle from the current value and maintains sync between:
- The internal angle state (`_currentAngle`)
- The visual handle position
- The actual weight value

## How It Works Now

1. **Touch Detection**: When user touches the dial, we calculate the angle from the touch position
2. **State Update**: The angle is immediately stored in the widget state using `setState()`
3. **Visual Update**: The painter uses the stored `_currentAngle` to position the handle
4. **Value Sync**: The weight value is calculated from the angle and passed to the parent

## Result

✅ **Handle follows touch accurately**: The handle now appears exactly where the user touches
✅ **Smooth dragging**: The handle stays under the user's finger during drag operations
✅ **Consistent behavior**: The visual position always matches the selected weight
✅ **Intuitive interaction**: Users can tap or drag anywhere on the dial circumference

The circular weight slider now provides the expected, intuitive behavior where the handle position directly corresponds to the user's touch point!
